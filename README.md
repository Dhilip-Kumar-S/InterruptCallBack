InterruptCallBack
=================

This is a simple tool to help us in Time Management at work (Windows 7)

This is based on the four quadrant task management idea inspired from below.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Things_First_(book)

This allows you to add the task accordingly, stores them in an excel sheet for persistence.

It is believed that a human mind is interrupted by train of thoughts every three minutes, hence the reminder is set to 3mins by default.

This tool is exactly triggered when your mind is interrupted every third minute calls you back to the task that you want to be focused.

Play, experiment and you are free to improve.

Note: Im not a C# developer.

Happy Time management. :-)

Future Improvements:

Automatic Circular Queue implementation of tasks.

Better time-spent and graphic visualisation.

Make it store in an XML instead of Excel.
